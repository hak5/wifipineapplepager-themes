## Version

Theme Version: 1.1

Firmware Version: 1.0.6


## Details

Contains layout changes to fit the theme.

Will continue to make more changes and improvements.

I referenced existing themes for help (including color_ui by RootJunky and chromatic_trout by JustSomeTrout).

I've never worked with json before, so forgive me for any issues.


## Features

- Main Dashboard Buttons feature a different sort order.

- Numeric keyboard updated to swap the backspace and done buttons.

- If you want the original numeric keyboard layout you can use the original files stored in the Futurama theme folders
